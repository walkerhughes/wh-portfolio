Welcome to Idiom.ai! ðŸ‘‹ Get ready for some awesome language practice.

**Here's how the game works**: 
1. Pick a language from the dropdown menu, and I'll give you a common idiom or figure of speech in that language along with an example of it being used in a sentence.
2. You'll get to choose its correct meaning from a list of 3 options. If you get it right first try, that's 1 point!  
3. No worries if you don't get it right on the first try. You can still get a half point for getting it right on the second guess. 
4. Don't get it by the second guess? I'll give a brief explanation of the correct answer before moving on.
