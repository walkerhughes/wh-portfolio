Welcome to Idiom.ai! 👋 Get ready for some awesome language practice. 

**Here's how the game works**: 
1. Pick a language from the dropdown menu, and I'll give you a common idiom or figure of speech in that language along with an example of it being used in a sentence.
2. You'll get to choose its correct meaning from a list of 3 options. If you get it right first try, that's 1 point!  
3. No worries if you don't get it right on the first try. You can still get a halp point for getting it right on the second guess.
